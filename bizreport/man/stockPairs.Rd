\title{Generate Stock Code Pairs and Their Counts}
\usage{
stockPairs(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing transaction data. Must include at least two columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{InvoiceNo}}{A column indicating invoice numbers.}
  \item{\code{StockCode}}{A column containing stock codes for each transaction.}
}}
}
\value{
A data frame with two columns:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{pairs}}{Unique stock code pairs in the format "StockCode1-StockCode2".}
    \item{\code{PairCount}}{The number of times each pair appears across all invoices.}
  }
}
\description{
This function takes a dataset of transactions and generates unique stock code pairs 
for each invoice, along with the number of times each pair occurs across all invoices. 
Duplicate counts (e.g., "A-B" and "B-A") are handled by ensuring pairs are counted only once.
}
\details{
The function processes the data as follows:
- Groups transactions by invoice.
- Identifies unique stock codes within each invoice.
- Generates all possible pairs of stock codes for each invoice, ensuring that "A-B" and "B-A" are treated as the same pair.
- Calculates the total count for each unique pair across all invoices.
}
\examples{
# Example dataset
transactions <- data.frame(
  InvoiceNo = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2),
  StockCode = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B")
)

# Generate stock pairs and their counts
stockPairs(transactions)
