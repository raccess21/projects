\title{Extract Top Stock Codes Likely to Be Added to Basket}
\usage{
stockCodesBasket(pairData, codes, num = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pairData}{A data frame containing stock code pairs and their frequencies. 
The data frame must include the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{\code{pairs}}{A column containing stock code pairs in the format "StockCode1-StockCode2".}
  \item{\code{PairCount}}{A column containing the frequency of each pair.}
}}

\item{codes}{A character vector containing the stock codes of interest. These stock codes will be used
to filter the pairs and to exclude them from the results.}

\item{num}{An integer specifying the number of top stock codes to return. If positive, the function 
returns the top `num` stock codes in descending order of `PairCount`. If negative, it returns the top 
`num` stock codes in ascending order of `PairCount`. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
A character vector of stock codes that are most likely to be added to the basket, based on their 
  association with the specified stock codes. The results are ordered by `PairCount`, and the original 
  stock codes provided in the `codes` argument are excluded.
}
\description{
This function identifies the most frequent stock codes that are likely to be added to the basket,
based on their association with a specified set of stock codes. The function works by filtering 
the pair data for the specified stock codes, excluding pairs that include the stock codes themselves,
then summarizing the pair counts, and returning the top `num` stock codes based on frequency.
The results can be sorted in either ascending or descending order based on the `num` parameter.
}
\details{
The function works as follows:
- Filters the data frame to retain only rows where the `pairs` column contains at least one of the 
  specified `codes`.
- Excludes rows where the stock codes in the pair are the same as any of the `codes` provided.
- Groups by the stock codes that are not in the `codes` list, summarizing the total count of their 
  pairings across all rows.
- Sorts the results based on the total pair count and returns the top `num` stock codes.

\examples{
# Example dataset
pairData <- data.frame(
  pairs = c("A-B", "A-C", "B-C", "C-D", "D-E", "A-D"),
  PairCount = c(10, 15, 5, 8, 3, 12)
)

# Find the top 2 stock codes most likely to be added to the basket with "A"
stockCodeBaskets(pairData, codes = "A", num = 2)

# Find the top 1 stock code most likely to be added to the basket with "A" and "B"
stockCodeBaskets(pairData, codes = c("A", "B"), num = 1)

}
